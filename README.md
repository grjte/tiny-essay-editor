# groundmist essay editor

This is a simple collaborative Markdown editor built in React, with inline format preview and inline commenting, based on the Ink & Switch "tiny essay editor". This fork makes minimal modifications to enable publishing essays to a public PDS on atproto.

The forked code repository *does not have a license file*. The implementation is reused and modified here with grateful permission from the [Ink & Switch](https://github.com/inkandswitch) team.

The rest of this README comes from Ink & Switch's original documentation.

-----

It's built on [automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge) and [automerge-repo](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo) for CRDT-based storage and sync. It uses [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net/) for markdown editing UI, and [automerge-codemirror](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-codemirror) to connect to Codemirror.

## Usage

If you visit the root domain the app will make a new doc. Or you can hit the New button.

Once you have a doc, the URL will update with a doc ID. If you share that URL to another browser/device, it should sync live. Hold on to the URL if you want to come back to that doc!

### Features

- Edit Markdown with inline format preview
- Write inline comments + replies
- Live sync through Automerge
- Stores data to local device
- Save out .md file with a Download button
- Typeset similarly to Ink & Switch essays

### Status

This app is primarily intended for internal use at Ink & Switch for editing essays, so there are some features that are specialized towards that use case. We don't plan to develop it into a general-purpose editor that anyone can use for anything. But of course, it can edit any Markdown document too. If you want to actually use this editor in earnest, you might want to fork it to build your own ideas.

Hopefully the code serves as a useful sample for building apps based on automerge-repo, automerge-codemirror, and React.

## Development

### Run it

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

### Dual deployment

This app is designed for normal webapp deployment as well as experimental deployment to an internal I&S platform. The code is almost entirely shared but there are two entry points:

- `src/main.tsx` is the normal app entry point
- `src/index.ts` is an experimental entry point which just exports some functions to a host environment

### Adding a new datatype

This app is actually a general framework for editing automerge docs in viewers, which currently has specific support for markdown documents and tldraw whiteboards.

Basic instructions to add a new datatype:

- copy an existing `src/{datatype}` directory as a template. `tee` is a reasonable example
- Fill in `src/<your_datatype>/datatype.ts` with a TS type, an init function, and other functions
- Add your new datatype to the `datatypes` map in `src/datatypes.ts`
-
